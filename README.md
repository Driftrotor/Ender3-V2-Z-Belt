# Ender3-V2-Z-Belt
 A Voron inspired Z belt conversion for the Ender 3 V2

 

This is my own take on a Z axis Belt Mod for the Ender 3 / V2 / Pro.

it is based on the Voron 2.4 Z axis gearbox and extensively modified to work on the ender 3 platform.

this is for use with duel z stepper motors and linier rails.

other additions to this mod to follow. (v roller wheels)

this is not a mod for the faint hearted and requires quite a bit of work and fixings to get it installed and working. the printed parts are fairly easy to print with only 2 parts needing supports (motor mounts) but you will requite that you printer is well tuned to print the parts with the tolerance required to fit the additional parts.

additional parts required are.

M3 x 30 cap heads

M3 x 20 cap heads

M5 x 10 button heads

M3 x 5 heat set nuts

M3 x 8 heat set nuts

M5 T nuts

M5 x 10 cap heads

M3 x 16 cap heads

2 x 16 tooth pullies 5mm bore

2 x 80 tooth pullies 5mm bore

4 x 20 tooth pullies 5mm bore

2 x 5mm dia rod / axle 31mm long

2 x 5mm dia rod / axle 58mm long

10 x 625RS bearings

2 x GT2 188 looped belts

2 meters GT2 belt (of your choice)

thank you for looking at my mod and Happy Printing!

 
for best results use the voron spec
5 top / bottom
4 perimeters
40% infill

if printing in an enclosure print with ABS / ABS+ / ASA
